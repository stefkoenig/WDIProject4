## Installation Instructions
## User Stories
#### Unregistered Users
* Users who are interested in planning a trip to or within California will access the site to get travel tips.
* On the homepage, users will see a map of California with pins dropped on recommended destinations. These pins will have different icons representing different types of destinations: outdoorsy, city, party, touristy, off the beaten path, etc. A legend on the homepage will outline what each icon represents. In future iterations, the icon size will be larger based on the amount of recommendations/likes the destination has.
* Users can click the map in order to zoom into that location to learn more and see recommended destinations.
* Users can click on destinations to see recommendations, comments, and pictures from other users and information from TripAdvisor.com.
